Execution Trace Analysis
Based on my analysis of runFastSimM.py and calcRopeForces.py, here's what happens with the Frope field from the profile input structure:

Answer: NO, the Frope field from the profile is NOT used as input anywhere in the simulation.
Here's the detailed execution trace:

1. Profile Fields Actually Used by calcRopeForces:
The calcRopeForces function (called on line 70 of runFastSimM.py) only uses these fields from the profile:

profile['Dist'] - Distance array
profile['leadNotch'] - Lead locomotive notch commands
profile['fence_flg'] - Fence flag for locomotive control
profile['remoteNotch'] - Remote locomotive notch commands
profile['Time'] - Time array
profile['Speed'] - Speed array
The profile['Frope'] field is completely ignored by calcRopeForces.

2. How Rope Forces Are Actually Calculated:
Instead of using profile['Frope'], the simulation:

Calculates locomotive forces from notch commands and speed using locomotive effort curves
Calculates gravity forces using track grade data
Calculates drag forces using Davis equation coefficients
Calculates inertial forces from acceleration
Combines all forces to compute rope forces: F = Fgravloco + Fdrag + Finertia
Applies cumulative sum to get coupler forces along the train
3. What Happens to the Calculated Forces:
The newly calculated rope forces F (from calcRopeForces) are converted to SI units: Frope_in0 = F * lbf_()
These calculated forces are then interpolated and grouped for the FastSim simulation: Fropesi
The original profile['Frope'] is never referenced again
4. Output Structure:
The final output includes:

out['Fropesi'] - The calculated and interpolated rope forces used in simulation
out['Frope_insi'] - The calculated rope forces passed into FastSim
out['profile'] - The original profile (including the unused Frope field)
Conclusion:
The profile['Frope'] field appears to be legacy data or perhaps validation data from a previous calculation, but it plays no role whatsoever in the actual simulation. The simulation recalculates all rope forces from first principles using locomotive effort, gravity, drag, and inertial force models.

This suggests that the Frope field in your profile data might be:

Legacy data from a previous simulation run
Reference data for validation purposes
Unused backup data that was intended for a different simulation mode
The simulation is completely physics-based and derives all forces from the locomotive notch commands, speed profile, track geometry, and train/locomotive parameters.
